## 🎯 What It Does

Built this at Property Pistol to automate the messy data cleaning work feeding into our main productivity dashboard. Sales reps' hours, leads, calls - all came in dirty Excel/CSV files that needed manual cleaning before analysis.

This tool handles three key workflows:

**SM Bifurcation** - Cleans sales manager assignments across multiple columns, extracts unique entries, normalizes data  
**Lead Qualification** - Batch processes multiple CSV files, auto-assigns sales heads, consolidates everything  
**Lead Analytics** - Full dashboard calculating quality metrics, visit ratios, conversion rates with multi-dimensional filtering

Automated what used to take 2-3 hours of manual Excel work into a 30-second upload.

## 💡 Why This Exists

Our productivity tracking tool needed clean input data. Sales exported messy reports from CRM. This sits in between - upload dirty files, get clean datasets ready for analysis.

Built for internal use only. Not production-grade, just solves the specific problem we had.
